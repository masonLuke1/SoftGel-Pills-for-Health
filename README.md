# SoftGel-Pills-for-Health

## Project Overview
The "BIT-ter Betty's" team has developed a Point of Sale (POS) system aimed at managing, altering, and ordering various types of pills. This system is designed to streamline operations for SoftGel Pills for Health, incorporating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.

## Objectives
Create a Robust System: Design a system that can efficiently handle different pill types, including their casings, medication values, and variations for children and adults.

Enhance Team Collaboration: Use Agile methodologies to improve communication and project management within our team.

## Team Members
Mason Luke, Cedric Terrell, Leo Barber, Austin Haynes, Nick Diglio

## Methodology
Agile Framework: We utilized Agile practices, including daily scrums, sprint planning, and retrospectives, to maintain project momentum. A Kanban board was employed to visualize progress and manage tasks effectively.

Version Control: Git was used for version control, enabling seamless collaboration and code management across the team.

## System Architecture
The system comprises three primary classes:

GelCap: The base class containing shared attributes for all pill types.

AcheAway: A subclass representing a pain reliever pill.

Dreamly: A subclass designed for insomnia relief.

## Key Features
Pill Manufacturing Process: The system includes methods to manufacture pills by creating casings and injecting solutions and active ingredients.

Unit Testing: Comprehensive unit tests are implemented to ensure code quality and functionality.

Demo Class: A demo class showcases the features and functionality of the POS system, providing an interactive user experience.
